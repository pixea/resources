### The logo itself
The logo consists of the brand name "pixea" and four color stripes representing the CMYK color model. This color model shows that the brand is connected to print.

![alt text](examples/Logotype.png "pixea logotype")
*This is the main logotype which should be displayed on every one of our products.*

![alt text](examples/Icon.png "pixea icon")
*This is the main icon which serves as an avatar and is useful anywhere where's a lack of space.*

### The usage of the logo
The logotype and the icon must be always displayed separately, never together. The logotype and the icon should not be used differently than is displayed here - without any visual effects, in other colors, in different aspect ratios and so on.

Empty space around the logotype and the icon, called the safe area, must always be used.

When it comes to the logotype, it must be used as displayed here:

*Watchout for the dot on letter "i", it does not count.*

And when it comes to the icon:

![alt text](examples/Icon_SafeArea.png "pixea icon safe area")

When changing the size of the logotype or the icon, the aspect ratio should be always the original and the size of at least one side should be a multiple of the number 4, for example, **320** x **124**px, **320** x 125px or 321 x **124**px.

The main background for the logotype and the icon is a light defined color, for other let's say a darker background, the black and white version of the logotype or the icon must be used.
